>> Creational Design Patterns:

    >> Singleton Pattern
    Singleton - Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and provide
    a global access point to the object.

    >> Factory Pattern
    Factory(Simplified version of Factory Method) - Creates objects without
    exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refers to the newly
    created object through a common interface.

    >> Factory Method Pattern
    Factory Method - Defines an interface for creating objects, but let
    subclasses to decide which class to instantiate and refers to the newly
    created object through a common interface.

    >> Abstract Factory Pattern
    Abstract Factory - Offers the interface for creating a family of related
    objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.

    >> Builder Pattern
    Builder - Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses
    decide which class to instantiate and allows a finer control over the
    construction process.

    >> Prototype Pattern
    Prototype - Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical
    instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

    >> Object Pool Pattern
    Object Pool - Reuses and shares objects that are expensive to create.
